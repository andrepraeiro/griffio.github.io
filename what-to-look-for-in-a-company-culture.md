When looking for a new job in Software development often the focus is on the years/months experience with a specific library/framework - Java (Spring, Hibernate), JavaScript (ReactJs) or NodeJs(Perhaps NodeJs doesn't discriminate for a particular framework - yet).

We may want to take a new job as a stepping stone, the quickest way to a pay rise is to change job or a salary multiplier needed for a first mortgage.

The companies are usually the following: a billable engagement consultancy, tech startup, legacy tech giant, software development boutique, or a business gaining more capacity for building software?

Individually, people are smart with hidden talents but unable to bring them to use due to established group-think or status quo (Everyone knows something is not smart but does it anyway so a to be seen as a heretic).

View as a slow and steady marathon over a rat race, (Marketing, not Software Development, should be used to get ideas expressed and disseminated quickly).

Productive doesn't mean producing continuously the same thing. Equating working 8hrs that produces 8 tonnes of coal. Time may be better spent on building documentation, learning from or training others.

Culture is developed through the latitude given to the employees natural tendency to do the right thing. Managers are important bulkheads that shield team members from excessive bureaucracy and meetings.

Environment drives Culture; Culture drives Brand.
