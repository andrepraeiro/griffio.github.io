Remote First

Imagine a new client/customer is launching; emails sent, logins released - action stations. Anyone with a vested interest or need to know should be available on demand - project managers, client managers, infrastructure folks to monitor performance.
Even if for a morning or a few hours all participants should be able to access "#hashtag" client.

This should be familiar to people who keep updated on social media, use their mobile apps for chat. Gamers;
how can usually random players co-operate in a game so successfully and play together? Chat, headsets, screen-in-screen video.

The assumption is that no-one is co-located or has to be completely synchronous to be able to participate.
