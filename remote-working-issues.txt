The downside of remote working are issues of trust and contractual obligations as they exist in an organisation's status quo.
In such cultures, the mindset is that everyone is distrustful of each other unless they can see them at their desks "working".
Working distributed means that work is fanned out and feedback and progress needs to be communicated back skillfully.
Co-location is needed where some work is by nature synchronous and must happen at the same time.
Actual absolute remote working is probably suitable for a minority of people and most people need a degree of flexibilty around commuting(not uncommon for contractual 40hr week and 15-20hr spent commuting).
It's not a zero-sum game and a working culture must be based around support for out-of-band communication, at a minimum for disaster recovery scenerios.
