The advocacy of Pair Programming is still presented in a quaint style of matey programmers working next to each other all day.  

One of the principles from Agile 

```
Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
- http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
```

Collabation in Software Development is quite noisy and there must be a consideration to placement in a private room where two or more developers can work with less inhibition. There is no point in adopting paired positions when the working environment is not fit for that purpose.

The ergonomics of working togther side by side in open plan spaces are not considered.

We can have the goal that nothing can compensate from knowing what you are producing is being reviewed and collaborated on in real time.

The key is to learn what to code as well as when and why.

It is presented that there is only one kind pairing :- 

Pilot and Co-Pilot - a monitoring backup pilot can assume command

Motorbike and Sidecar - attached passenger along for the ride 

Learner Driver and Instructor - dual controls can override 

[Pantomime Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_horse) - positioned one behind the other, one person acts as the horse's front half, the other forms the hind part

[Bert & Ernie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_and_Ernie) -  A pair of inseparable Muppets 

[Eric B. & Rakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_B._%26_Rakim) - DJ and MC; only one is the G.O.A.T

### The Cargo Cult of Enterprise Agile

You may have encountered Agile Consultants, on billable engagement, intoning that Pair Programming is the "most important" aspect of the development cycle.

If it's that important then what does a Pair Programming working environment actually look like and why don't they advocate for that as a prerequisite?

Consultants are parachuted in to complete the box ticking exercise adopting the "myth-dream" of Agile.

In reality, it looks like two developers working at a standard sized desk - awkwardly squeezed armrest to armrest flailing at the shared keyboard and mouse controls;repeated across the working space with other developers sitting like ducks in a row - All talking at once.

This open space is supposed to evoke a War-Room with developers communicating "intensely" -
notes from The Practices of Extreme Programming - Agile Software Development (Robert C Martin)

Peer Programming not Pair Programming

Developers shouldn't be too worried that they are not pair programming to the current dogma but have a remote working environment. 

Some kind of Peer Programming enables the quickest way to stop defective code from making it into production.

Code reviews by nature happen too late in the process; often cited as the reason for Pairing.

Identify the earliest possible moment at which to identify/fix code.
One, two or more developers
Pair Programming can be anaemic. Is it Pilot and Co-pilot? Motorcycle and Sidecar, Pantomime Horse or two bickering Muppets?
Every organization is a distributed system.
Peer Programming is familiar to online gaming. Immediate, get in the zone, headsets - may not even know team-mates.

Can the primary means of achieving code quality be knowledge sharing across the code base and across the team?
We can find and highlight examples of good code even if we are not actively working on same code base.
Binary development can go off the rails the same as a unary developer; Anyone should be able to stage an intervention and stop code being written at all;
Giving developers the right environment will allow them the latitude to figure it out for themselves - be it Pair Programming or Quad Programming.
