summary: Facebook Open-plan for thousands
---

According to Internet reports, Facebook have created a single working space that fits thousands of employees, code named [mpk20](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mpk20), designed by the architect shop Frank Gehry LLC.

Their goal was to create the perfect engineering space for teams to work together.

For some this will be [Utopia](http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Facebook-West-designed-by-Frank-Gehry-3814171.php) or [pig heaven](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/10/business/fi-playa10), other employees will need to be augmented with a pair of ear-cans and only wish they had read [PeopleWare](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL31274M/Peopleware) instead.

But now that Facebook have planted a stake in the ground - such an extreme position opens up a spectrum of commercial advantage for other “hacker” shops to [differentiate](https://vimeo.com/97903574) themselves in the same market for these employees, and [a tool to poach](https://www.theinformation.com/ubers-latest-hiring-perk-no-commute) from Facebook.

**Environment drives Culture; Culture drives Brand**
