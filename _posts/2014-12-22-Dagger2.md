# Dagger2 - creating a typesafe dependency injection graph at compilation

## [https://github.io/dagger](http://google.github.io/dagger)

#### Intro

Dagger2 uses the class [javax.inject.Inject](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/inject/Inject.html) to annotate the constructors and fields that need dependencies.
The annotation class [dagger.Provides](http://google.github.io/api/latest/dagger/Provides.html) is used to describe a method that can satisfy a dependency.
The resulting @Inject and @Provides annotated classes form a graph of objects.

Annotation processor support is used to generate the dependency graph [Plugging into the Java Compiler](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/fileDownload/session/14BBC4CA8DD69CBF9BA12D7B6601C106/CON4265_McManus-Plugging-into-the-Java-Compiler.pdf).
