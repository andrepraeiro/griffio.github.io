## Remote First

### What is a Remote First culture?

Companies that adopt remote working practices are going to be way ahead in how their brand is ultimately perceived (i.e not like [Yahoo](http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/)). But favourably instead;by potential employees who now want to be employed there.

Environment Drives Culture, Culture Drives Brand.

Company management may be better swayed into adopting Remote First when a positive reception can cause the share price to increase rather than it makes employees happy|motivated.

What can it solve?

Remote First adoption by a Company means that these weaknesses are exposed and can be acted on.
