### What is a Remote First culture?

Companies that adopt remote first working practices are going to be way ahead in how their brand is ultimately perceived, i.e the opposite of [Yahoo](http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/), and that is favourably by potential employees who now want to be employed there.

_Environment Drives Culture, Culture Drives Brand_.

Company management, ones with pointy hair, may only see benefits to adopting a remote first culture when an external positive response causes the Company share price to increase rather than it simply makes employees happy/motivated.

**What communication problems can be improved when the first assumption is that teams are not co-located?**

Remote First adoption by companies means that the weaknesses below are exposed and can be acted on for the benefit of all employees.

* Attendance does not always equal productivity

* Lack of diversity in hiring or retention of valuable knowledge if employees have to leave
  
* Salaries, [Rents](https://www.zumper.com/blog/2015/03/san-francisco-rent-prices-continue-rapid-rise-february/) and Commuting costs increasing in San Francisco/London make remote working more rational and logical.
  * Either that or Tech knowledge workers will have to live in conditions next to their place of [employment](https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/progress-report/)
 
* If you are communicating by email then you are effectively remote.
  * Do employees read their emails aloud when working side by side?

* Email is an ineffective communication tool to raise tickets and get answers.
  * e.g Try contacting your IT Helpdesk - this what it feels like to be remote.

* Provincial culture - local teams working in Desk Farms - local assumptions.
  * Poor knowledge sharing. Ever experienced contacting these teams by email to source information? 

* Single Point of Failure. Contingency Planning. Disaster recovery.
  * Marching ants.
 
* Depending on your circumstances the best time for productivity is lost commuting.

**Be intentional**

* If teams choose to work in the same location. Provide a quality working environment and not Desk Farms.

* If one team member is remote, all the team is effectively remote in attitude.

* Video technologies allow everyone to show up to meetings equally so they can make decisions too.

* Remotes should not lag behind the decision makers because of the perception that speed is the deciding factor.

* Do not make distributed teams across timezones work outside of their normal scheduled hours.

* Todays software is built around the idea that you are not co-located - Mobile messaging, VOIP.
  * Companies that make this kind of software and are not Remote First, its like saying your products don't work.

* Tools gaining growth and mindshare that work locally and remote such as [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Distributed version control](https://github.com).

* Remote first teams can become increasingly skilful and have better empathy
  * The skill set to acquire in the next few years is distributed working practices

As [discussed](/facebook/2015/04/05/Facebook-openplan/), how do you compete for hires?

If you are Apple you can compete by building a [big space ship](http://www.cupertino.org/index.aspx?page=1107).

If the perception of your company is still taken from the inertia when it first put Radio on the Internet in 1999, then Remote First offers a methodology and a brand to make it relevant instead of adding ephemeral benefits like ping pong, catered lunches.

Initially, Teams can adopt practices faster than the whole company. Start there.
