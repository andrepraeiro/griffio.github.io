### What is a Remote First culture?

Companies that adopt remote working practices are going to be way ahead in how their brand is ultimately perceived , i.e The opposite of [Yahoo](http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/), and favourably instead by potential employees who now want to be employed there.

Environment Drives Culture, Culture Drives Brand.

Company management, ones with pointy hair, may be swayed into adopting a Remote First Culture when a positive reception can cause the share price to increase rather than it simply makes employees happy/motivated.

**What can it solve when the perception that workers are co-located is not the first assumption?**

Remote First adoption by Companies means that the weaknesses below are exposed and can be acted on.

* Attendance does not always equal productivity

* Lack of diversity in hiring and rentention of valuable knowlegde if employees have to leave
  
* Salaries, [Rents](https://www.zumper.com/blog/2015/03/san-francisco-rent-prices-continue-rapid-rise-february/) and Commuting costs increasing in San Francisco/London make remote working more rational and logical.
  * Either that or Tech knowledge workers will have to live in conditions next to their place of [employment](https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/progress-report/)
 
* If you are communicating by email then you are effectively remote. 
  * Do employees read their emails aloud when working side by side?

* Email is ineffective communication to raise tickets and get answers.
  * e.g Try contacting your IT Helpdesk - this what it feels like to be remote.

* Provincial culture - local teams working in Desk Farms - local assumptions.
  * Poor knowlege sharing. Ever experienced contacting these teams by email to source information? 

* Single Point of Failure. Contingency Planning. Disaster recovery
  * Marching ants 
 
* Depending on your circumstances the best time for productivity is lost commuting.

**Be intentional**

* If one team member is remote, all the team is effectively remote in attitude

* Video technologies allow everyone to show up to meetings equally so they can make decisions too

* Remotes should not lag behind the decision makers because of the perception that speed is the deciding factor

* Do not make distributed teams across timezones work outside of their normal scheduled hours

* Todays software is built around the idea that you are not co-located - Mobile messaging, VOIP
  * Companies that make this kind of software and are not Remote First, its like saying your products don't work

* Tools gaining growth and mindshare that work locally and remote such as Slack, Trello, Distributed version control.

* Remote teams can become increasingly skilful
  * The skill set to acquire in the next few years is distributed working practices

As [discussed](/facebook/2015/04/05/Facebook-openplan/), how do you compete for hires?

If you are Apple you can compete by building a [big space ship](http://www.cupertino.org/index.aspx?page=1107).

If the perception of your company is mediocre/stagnant, only known from when it first put Radio on the Internet in 1999, Remote First offers a methodology and a brand instead of ephemeral benefits - ping pong, catered lunches.

Initially, Teams can adopt practices faster than the whole company. Start there.
