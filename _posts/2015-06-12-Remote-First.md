### What is a Remote First culture?

Companies that adopt remote working practices are going to be way ahead in how their brand is ultimately perceived, i.e opposite of [Yahoo](http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/), and that is favourably by potential employees who now want to be employed there.

Environment Drives Culture, Culture Drives Brand.

Company management, ones with pointy hair, may be swayed into adopting a Remote First Culture when a positive reception can cause the share price to increase rather than it simply makes employees happy/motivated.

**What communication problems can be improved when the first assumption is that teams are not co-located?**

Remote First adoption by Companies means that the weaknesses below are exposed and can be acted on.

* Attendance does not always equal productivity

* Lack of diversity in hiring and rentention of valuable knowledge if employees have to leave
  
* Salaries, [Rents](https://www.zumper.com/blog/2015/03/san-francisco-rent-prices-continue-rapid-rise-february/) and Commuting costs increasing in San Francisco/London make remote working more rational and logical.
  * Either that or Tech knowledge workers will have to live in conditions next to their place of [employment](https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/progress-report/)
 
* If you are communicating by email then you are effectively remote. 
  * Do employees read their emails aloud when working side by side?

* Email is ineffective communication to raise tickets and get answers.
  * e.g Try contacting your IT Helpdesk - this what it feels like to be remote.

* Provincial culture - local teams working in Desk Farms - local assumptions.
  * Poor knowlege sharing. Ever experienced contacting these teams by email to source information? 

* Single Point of Failure. Contingency Planning. Disaster recovery
  * Marching ants 
 
* Depending on your circumstances the best time for productivity is lost commuting.

**Be intentional**

* Lots of teams choose to work in the same location. Provide a quality working environment and not Desk Farms

* If one team member is remote, all the team is effectively remote in attitude

* Video technologies allow everyone to show up to meetings equally so they can make decisions too

* Remotes should not lag behind the decision makers because of the perception that speed is the deciding factor

* Do not make distributed teams across timezones work outside of their normal scheduled hours

* Todays software is built around the idea that you are not co-located - Mobile messaging, VOIP
  * Companies that make this kind of software and are not Remote First, its like saying your products don't work

* Tools gaining growth and mindshare that work locally and remote such as Slack, Trello, Distributed version control.

* Remote first teams can become increasingly skilful and have better empathy
  * The skill set to acquire in the next few years is distributed working practices

As [discussed](/facebook/2015/04/05/Facebook-openplan/), how do you compete for hires?

If you are Apple you can compete by building a [big space ship](http://www.cupertino.org/index.aspx?page=1107).

If the perception of your company is mediocre/stagnant, only known from when it first put Radio on the Internet in 1999, Remote First offers a methodology and a brand instead of ephemeral benefits - ping pong, catered lunches.

Initially, Teams can adopt practices faster than the whole company. Start there.
