[Canary in a coal mine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine)

```
An allusion to caged canaries (birds) that miners would carry down into the mine tunnels with them. If dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide collected in the mine, the gases would kill the canary before killing the miners, thus providing a warning to exit the tunnels immediately.
```

There are many descriptive accounts of job search ordeals involving some code challenge task that is to be completed under our own time and initiative.

Turning it around, this code challenge is a good cultural indicator about the companies internal organisation and thinking.

Apart from your CV|Resume, there is little for the employer to glean about you the "random” internet person that has applied.

The code challenge as a capture, verifies I am not a robot.

You are a bot and it's your job to prove you are more than just [dark matter](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DarkMatterDevelopersTheUnseen99.aspx) of unknown provenance.

Like a thundering herd, eventually one will succeed and thus validate an arduous hiring process. See! Our process works. Only the strong survived.

One elaborate coding challenge cannot address all contradictions about real people.
People that may not have a lot of real experience, but good at building skills. Not all people have or want to put out blog posts, have public source code, but have a variety of projects. People with or without a computer science background. People new to software development but experienced in life. People at all points in between.

For most development jobs there are a lot more people capable of performing the work than code challenges would imply. From the  [stackoverflow 2016 survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education) Over half of developers identify with being self-taught.

Ultimately the interview is a two way process to discover if People will have a positive impact after we hire them and the company will provide a positive impact too.

One good aspect of asking for code in interviews, when people write code they can't help making creating something unique.

We don’t need better tech interviews, we need better companies.
If companies treat people without empathy during recruitment what does it say about working there?

Improvements companies can make.

Is the interview process documented?

Have team members been hired already using the process or has it been invented after wards and is needed to handle scaling of new hiring? Can existing team members pass their own interview?

Interviews are an like on-boarding process for employees who are from another timezone - one that has yet to occur.

Change the assumptions and ask if the company is good enough for the person applying. Why would they work here?

The "donut light" for hiring should always be on. When someone who is interested stops by, interview them. Companies can add all their job specs, in markdown, into GitHub for a quick open source win
