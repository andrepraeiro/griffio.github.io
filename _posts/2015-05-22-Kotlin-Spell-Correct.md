summary: Kotlin spelling correct example
---

Converted from [Novig's spell-correct](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html).

A  "big.txt" file is loaded to train the spelling correction program with the permutations and probabilty count of words (see wordsN).

Mostly Kotlin, as at [kotlin 1.0.0](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/build-1.0.0).

Adding "or" infix extension to List<String> to return first non empty List of Lists (a or b or c).
