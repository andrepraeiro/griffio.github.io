### [Kotlin for-loops](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#for-loops)

Normally when encountering a new language the first point of interest is looking at the looping, repeating syntax - a common question is why Kotlin doesnâ€™t support the traditional **for-loop** structure below:

``` java
for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
  println(i)
}
```

Instead, **for** works on extensible expressions that return an iterator(), next() or hasNext() method:

```  kotlin
for (i in 0..99) {
  println(i)
}
```
---

The Kotlin core library [repeat](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/repeat.html) function implementation is a **for** wrapper that provides a zero-based iteration index:

``` kotlin 

public inline fun repeat(times: Int, action: (Int) -> Unit) {
  for (index in 0..times - 1) {
    action(index)
  }
}
```

```
repeat(times) {
  println(it)
}
```
---

[with-index](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/with-index.html) on collections provides an iterator object containing index and value: 

``` kotlin
for ((index,value) in ('a'..'z').withIndex()) {
  // index is 0..25 value is 'a..z'
  println("$index $value")
}
```

---

As the [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html#for-loops) specifies that **for** operates over anything that provides an iterator.

If we want to make our own classes iterable without using inheritance, we can make it work with the **for** idiom by providing a iterator operator implementation.

Let's make the sides of the Shape Object iterable and also the support forEach extension method :-

``` kotlin

class Shape(val sides: Int) {

  public operator fun iterator() = (1..sides).iterator() 

  public inline fun forEach(action: (Int) -> Unit): Unit {
    for (element in this) action(element)
  }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {

  val shape = Shape(sides = 6)

  for (side in shape) {
    println("This is side $side")
  }

  shape.forEach { println("This is side $it") }
}

```
