# Dagger2 - creating a typesafe dependency injection graph at compilation

## [https://github.io/dagger](http://google.github.io/dagger)

#### Intro

Dagger2 uses existing javax.inject.Inject to annotate the constructors and fields that need dependencies.
The annotation dagger.Provides describes a method that can satisfy a dependency.
The resulting @Inject and @Provides annotated classes form a graph of objects.
