summary: six degrees of pair programming

Often the Pair programming is presented as in naive way of matey programmers working next to each other all day.

The ergonomics of working togther and the rest of the open plan spaces are not considered.

### Cargo Cult Enterprise Agile

Often Agile Consultants, on billable engagments, intone that Pair Programming is the "most important" aspect of the development cycle.

If it's that important then what does a Pair Programming working environment look like and why don't they advocate for that?

Mostly it looks like two developers working at a standard sized desk - squeezed armrest to armrest awkardly flailing at the a shared keyboard and mouse controls and then repeated with the other developers squashed ducks in a row - All talking at once.

Peer Programming not Pair Programming

Some kind of Peer programming not necessarily Pair Programming enables the quickest way to stop from making it 

Code reviews by nature happen too late in the process.

Earliest possible moment at which to identify/fix code
One, two or more developers
Pair Programming can be anaemic. Is it Pilot and Co-pilot? Motorcycle and Sidecar, Pantomime Horse or two bickering developers?
Peer Programming is familiar to online gaming. Immediate, get in the zone, headsets - may not even know team-mates.
Code Reviews

Should not be the primary means of achieving code quality, knowledge sharing across the code base and across the team.
We can find and highlight examples of good code even if we are not actively working on same code base

Even staging an intevention and stop code being written at all.

Giving developers the right environment will allow them the latitude to figure it out for themselves - be it Pair Programming or Quad Programming.
