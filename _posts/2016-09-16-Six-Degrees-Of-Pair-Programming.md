Often the advocacy of Pair Programming is still presented in a quaint style of matey programmers working next to each other all day. 

One of the principles from Agile 

```
Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
- http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
```

Collabation in Software Development is quite noisy and there must be a consideration to placement in a private room where two or more developers can work with less inhibition. There is no point in adopting paired positions when the working environment is not fit for that purpose.

The ergonomics of working togther side by side in open plan spaces are not considered.

Nothing can compensate from knowing what you are producing is being reviewed and collaborated on in real time.
The key is to learn what to program as well as when and why.

Not all pairing modes are equal or even desirable :- 

Pilot and Co-Pilot - backup pilot

Motorbike and Sidecar - attached passenger 

Learner Driver and Instructor - dual controls can override

[Pantomime Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_horse) - positioned one behind the other, one person acts as the horse's front half, the other forms the hind part

[Bert & Ernie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_and_Ernie) -  A pair of inseparable Muppets 

[Eric B. & Rakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_B._%26_Rakim) - DJ and MC, only one is the G.O.A.T

### Cargo Culting Enterprise Agile

Often Agile Consultants, on billable engagments, intone that Pair Programming is the "most important" aspect of the development cycle.

If it's that important then what does a Pair Programming working environment look like and why don't they advocate for that?

Mostly it looks like two developers working at a standard sized desk - squeezed armrest to armrest awkardly flailing for the  shared keyboard and mouse controls and then repeated across the working space with the other developers squashed up like ducks in a row - All talking at once.

Peer Programming not Pair Programming

Some kind of Peer programming not necessarily Pair Programming enables the quickest way to stop defective code from making it into production

Code reviews by nature happen too late in the process.

Identify the earliest possible moment at which to identify/fix code.
One, two or more developers
Pair Programming can be anaemic. Is it Pilot and Co-pilot? Motorcycle and Sidecar, Pantomime Horse or two bickering Muppets?
Every organization is a distributed system.
Peer Programming is familiar to online gaming. Immediate, get in the zone, headsets - may not even know team-mates.
Code Reviews

Should not be the primary means of achieving code quality, knowledge sharing across the code base and across the team.
We can find and highlight examples of good code even if we are not actively working on same code base
Anyone should be able to stage an intervention and stop code being written at all.

Giving developers the right environment will allow them the latitude to figure it out for themselves - be it Pair Programming or Quad Programming.
