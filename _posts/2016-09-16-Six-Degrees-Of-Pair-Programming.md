summary: six degrees of pair programming

Often advocacy of Pair Programming is presented as in a quaint style of matey programmers working next to each other all day.

One of the principles from Agile

```
Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
- http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
```

Collabation in developement is quite noisy and should consider placing in a private room where two or more developers can work with less inhibition. There is no point is adopting when the working environment is not fit for purpose.

The ergonomics of working togther side by side and with open plan spaces are not considered.

Nothing can compensate from knowing what you are producing is being reviewed and collaborated on in real time.
The key is to learn what to program as well as when and why.

Not all modes are equal 

Pilot and Co-Pilot - backup pilot

Motorbike and Sidecar - attached passenger 

Learner Driver and Instructor - dual controls can override

[Pantomime Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime_horse) - A comedic act with cooperating and synchronized movements

[Bert & Ernie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_and_Ernie) -  A pair of inseparable Muppets 

[Eric B. & Rakim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_B._%26_Rakim) - DJ and MC duo, but only one is the G.O.A.T

### Cargo Cult Enterprise Agile

Often Agile Consultants, on billable engagments, intone that Pair Programming is the "most important" aspect of the development cycle.

If it's that important then what does a Pair Programming working environment look like and why don't they advocate for that?

Mostly it looks like two developers working at a standard sized desk - squeezed armrest to armrest awkardly flailing at the a shared keyboard and mouse controls and then repeated with the other developers squashed up like ducks in a row - All talking at once.

Peer Programming not Pair Programming

Some kind of Peer programming not necessarily Pair Programming enables the quickest way to stop defective code from making it into production

Code reviews by nature happen too late in the process.

Identify the earliest possible moment at which to identify/fix code.
One, two or more developers
Pair Programming can be anaemic. Is it Pilot and Co-pilot? Motorcycle and Sidecar, Pantomime Horse or two bickering Muppets?
Every organization is a distributed system.
Peer Programming is familiar to online gaming. Immediate, get in the zone, headsets - may not even know team-mates.
Code Reviews

Should not be the primary means of achieving code quality, knowledge sharing across the code base and across the team.
We can find and highlight examples of good code even if we are not actively working on same code base

Anyone should be able to stage an intevention and stop code being written at all.


Giving developers the right environment will allow them the latitude to figure it out for themselves - be it Pair Programming or Quad Programming.
