### Death Star CI

The [Death Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Star) is a fictional spacecraft and superweapon designed to intimidate and be used asymetically against opponents that cannot repel firepower of that magnitude.

It is also, a single point of failure that ravenously consumes resources.

Sounds familiar? Your Continuous Integration Server may actually operate like a Death Star.

### Don't break the build 

Many developers and technologists think they identify with the plucky [Rebel Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Alliance) and not as the technicians, pictured above, sitting at their consoles in front of blinking lights.

*Build shaming is not an acceptable* way of handling build fails by calling out, paying fines etc that it creates a cycle of blame culture.

If the success of your engineering project revolves around the use of group think to make team members do the right thing to fix the build, then they clearly don't have the latitude to make improvements by themselves. 

Like a Death Star that can be defeated by a small defect like a failing test then it is simply too big.

The solution isn't to try and keep your Death Star fully operational and on schedule by threating a visit from a [Sith Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith).
