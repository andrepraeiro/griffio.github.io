### Death Star CI

The [Death Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Star) is a fictional spacecraft and superweapon designed to intimidate and be used asymetically against opponents that cannot repel firepower of that magnitude.

It is also, a single point of failure that ravenously consumes resources.

Sounds familiar? Your Continuous Integration Server may actually operate like a Death Star.
